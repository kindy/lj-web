# Lightweight Web Framework Based On ngx_openresty

Maybe you will like lapis( https://github.com/leafo/lapis ), it's also base on ngx_openresty

## Example

```
local web = require 'lj.web'

web.route {'/hello/:name', function(req, resp, param)
    resp:printf {'hello, %s!\n', param.name}
end}

web.run()
```


## How To Get Start

### install ngx_openresty first

quick step or see detail at: http://openresty.org/#Installation

```
# filesize: 2.9M
$ curl -O http://agentzh.org/misc/nginx/ngx_openresty-1.2.6.1.tar.gz
$ tar zxf ngx_openresty-1.2.6.1.tar.gz
$ cd ngx_openresty-1.2.6.1/
# you should use --with-luajit
# if you install other path than /usr/local/openresty, you should change the path in following step too
$ ./configure --with-luajit --prefix=/usr/local/openresty && make && sudo make install
```

### install lj-web

```
# filesize: 28K
$ curl -O http://kindy.github.com/lj-web/files/lj-web-0.0.1rc1.tar.gz
$ tar zxf lj-web-0.0.1rc.tar.gz
$ cd lj-web-0.0.1rc1/
# please fix the openresty install path to match your system
$ sudo make install OPENRESTY_PREFIX=/usr/local/openresty
# I think you'd like to add the bin to you $PATH
```

### try lj-web

the ngx_openresty version "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" (ss means "simple server")

```
# press ctrl+C to quit
$ lj-web ss
# or you want to use different port:
$ lj-web ss -l:9002
```

try the example app

```
# you can try the example.lua app in the dist dir (press ctrl+C to quit):
# default port is 9090, and, it can not be change at this time, sorry for that.
$ lj-web run example.lua
# open a new shell:
$ curl -v localhost:9090/baidu
$ curl -v localhost:9090/hello/lj-web
```

that's it.
